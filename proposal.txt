C3C Sylvester and I will implement a chess game using a GUI and object-based programing.  The game will allow players to maneuver freely with respect to the rules, however, will not detect check or checkmate (this will be determined by the player). If a king is eliminated, the game will be over and a player will win. Player classes and game objects will be used, with a nested list tracking player locations.
